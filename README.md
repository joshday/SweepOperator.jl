The symmetric sweep operator is a powerful tool in computational statistics with uses in stepwise regression, conditional multivariate normal distributions, MANOVA, and more.  This package exports a single function:

## `sweep!`

```julia
sweep!(A, k ; inv=false)
sweep!(A, ks; inv=false)
```

Perform the sweep operation (or inverse sweep if `inv=true`) on symmetric matrix `A` on
element `k` (or each element in `ks`).  **Only the upper triangle is read/swept.**

### Example:

```julia
x = randn(100, 10)
xtx = x'x
sweep!(xtx, 1)
sweep!(xtx, 1, true)
```
